This is the PREVIOUS and UNSUPPORTED ttylinux build system.  This build
system will retard the natural progress of ttylinux development.  It is a
simple build system for a small family of very small Linux systems for
several CPU architectures.  See the How_To_* files in the ttylinux-build/doc
directory.
