Currently, ttylinux uses the kernel tree available at

https://github.com/hvaibhav/am335x-linux

This kernel tree is actively developed and now may have changes that do not
work with the current ttylinux BeagleBone kernel configuration file.  The last
commit to this tree at the time this kernel tree was gotten for ttylinux was
'521b08edffc6ea27144cc7d1787c0b9528470d41'.

Get the kernel source tree and put it in the xbuildtool/pkg-src directory, then
make the beagle_bone cross-tool chain; after that, read the
How_To_Build_ttylinux.txt file.
