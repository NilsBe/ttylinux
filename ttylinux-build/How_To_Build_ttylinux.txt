===============
1. Introduction
===============

In the following descriptions there are example commands; they are prefixed by
a shell prompt of "$ ", and comments to shell commands begin with the shell
comment character '#".


===========
2. Licenses
===========

The ttylinux xbuildtool:
- guide document is licensed under the FSF FDL1
- make system is licensed under the FSF GPL2
- components are GNU and Linux kernel projects licensed under FSF GPL
  versions 2 or 3.

The ttylinux make system, documents, and the base file system package are all
licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), a copy of which you can
find in the file doc/COPYING.

The component source packages, in the pkg-src/ directory, are licensed under a
number of different licenses.  The License section of the User Guide,
doc/User_Guide.html, has an overview of the packages' licenses.  For more
details, refer to the source packages.


========================
3. Building Requirements
========================

To build ttylinux you need the build system, which contains this file so you
must already have it, and the individual source packages that need to be stored
in the pkg-src/ directory.

A tarball of the build system can be downloaded from the ttylinux homepage,
which currently is located at the following URLs.

     http://ttylinux.net/
     http://ttylinux.org/

The build process creates device nodes, sets ownership and privileges for
root-owned files and mounts loopback file system images; therefore, you need to
be root, uid 0 and guid 0, to run the build process.

You will need at least 750 MB of free disk space to complete the build; the
first build process includes building a cross-compiler tool chain with a full
cross-building Binutils, GCC and GLIBC.  Subsequent ttylinux builds use an
xbuildtool cross-compiling tool chain and require about 400 MB.

On a 2.1 Ghz dual Athlon MP 2800 with 1.5 GB of RAM:
i486 xbuildtool chain build ...... 54:55.47 elapsed time, 147% CPU utilization
x86_64 xbuildtool chain build .... 56:38.42 elapsed time, 149% CPU utilization
i486 ttylinux build .............. 34:13.02 elapsed time, 105% CPU utilization
x86_64 ttylinux build ............ 33:47.21 elapsed time, 109% CPU utilization

On ThinkPad W500 with Core(tm)2 Duo P8600 at 2.4 Ghz with 2.0 GB of RAM:
i486 xbuildtool chain build ...... 25:59.91 elapsed time, 155% CPU utilization
x86_64 xbuildtool chain build .... 27:14.13 elapsed time, 156% CPU utilization
i486 ttylinux build .............. 17:44.04 elapsed time, 108% CPU utilization
x86_64 ttylinux build ............ 18:17.83 elapsed time, 107% CPU utilization

Software Requirements
---------------------

ttylinux is actively developed on a custom Linux distribution; there is not an
officially supported Linux distribution used for ttylinux development.

xbuildtool digression:
     xbuildtool is a ttylinux project; it is used to build at least one cross-
     compiling tool chain, and a cross tool chain is used to build ttylinux.  A
     cross-compiling tool chain, a set of tools consisting of Binutils, GCC and
     GLIBC with Linux kernel header files all targeting a Linux different from
     the host system's Linux, is built first, then the cross-compiling tool
     chain is used to build ttylinux.  The goal is that a cross-compiling tool
     chain can be built on almost any recent version of Linux, and that enables
     the building of a single configuration of ttylinux from almost any Linux
     host.  For example: The i486 target cross-compiling tool chain can be
     built on almost any recent Linux system, and each one of those i486 target
     cross-compiling tool chains may be different as each is appropriately
     built for the differing host systems running on various different Linux
     systems; although, each cross-compiling tool chain is the same version of
     Binutls+GCC+GLIBC and they all cross-build the same i486 code resulting in
     a common i486 ttylinux.

The following are the software development tools and their versions that are
used to develop and maintain the ttylinux cross-compiling tool chains and
ttylinux.  Roughly the same versions installed on a typical Linux distribution
ought to work.

=====================================
4. Build a Cross-compiling Tool Chain
=====================================

Note you do NOT need to be root.

ttylinux uses a cross-compiler tool set that needs to be setup.  The setup
downloads the source packages for Binutils, GCC, and Linux, then compiles these
with your system's compiler to create the cross-building tool chain.

xbuildtool is outside the ttylinux directory.  xbuildtool can build multiple
different cross-compiling tool chains; these cross-compiling tool chains may
have different versions of Binutils, GCC, GLIBC and Linux kernel header files.

xbuildtool is setup to make standard cross-compiling tool chains for ttylinux;
go to the xbuildtool-x.x directory and type "make help" to find out how to
make a cross-compiling tool chains for ttylinux.

The "make setup" command prepares xbuildtool for building tool chains.  The
process of making a tool chain begins by downloading the needed source code
packages; over 100 MB will be downloaded, be patient.

Read the file xbuildtool-x.x/config/xbt-build-config.sh to learn how to make
your own custom cross-compiling tool chain.

=================
5. Build ttylinux
=================

You need to be root, uid and gid both need to be 0.

-----------------------------------------
5.1. Selecting the Platform Configuration
-----------------------------------------

The ttylinux build system: it builds ttylinux for a given platform
configuration; the platform is the hardrware system, such as an i686 PC or
Macintosh G4, etc.

Before building, you select the platform configuration with this command:

     $ make getcfg

You will be given a list of platform configurations; select one by typing the
number in the list and then the Enter key.

You can change the current platform configuration by editing the new
ttylinux-config.sh file that is created by the "make getcfg" command.

--------------------------------
5.2. Downloading Source Packages
--------------------------------

In the ttylinux directory, give this command to download source packages:

     $ make dload

You may already have all the needed source packages.  Copy any source packages
to ~/Download and the "make dload" command will get them from there, as a local
cache.

Different ttylinux targets have different components, so you need to run
"make dload" at least once for each different ttylinux target you want to
build.

-----------------------------
5.3. Running the Make Command
-----------------------------

In the ttylinux directory, try "make help".

Now give this make command:

     $ make dist

or try these:

     $ make clean
     $ make init
     $ make pkgs
     $ make fsys
     $ make kernel
     $ make distdir
     $ make distimg

NOTE About True Cross-building With xbuildtools
     GLIBC is built with, and is a part of, the cross-compiling tool chains
     built with xbuildtool; it is configured with something like
     "--enable-kernel=2.6.0" and built against the Linux kernel headers files
     used by the cross tool chain.  All other ttylinux packages are cross-built
     against this GLIBC and its Linux kernel header files.  Please, don't use a
     custom Linux kernel with ttylinux that is older than the cross tool Linux
     kernel headers, or your nose will fall off and you'll get a bunch of
     pimples.

--------------------------------
5.4. Build an Individual Package
--------------------------------

An individual package, whether it is in the package list or not, can be built;
the following example builds the bash package.

     $ make PACKAGE=bash-4.1 bash-4.1

This command can be performed anytime after "make init"; any previous build of
the package is overwritten.  This is handy when developing and modifying
individual packages, particularly those that are not in the package list.

---------------------------------------------
5.5. Continuing or Resuming Build of Packages
---------------------------------------------

If a package fails to build and you fix the problem, you can continue building
the packages starting with the last failed package build; use this command:

     $ make pkgs_

You can test this command by interrupting the package build process with CTRL-C
and then giving the "make pkgs_" command.

================
6. Build Results
================

Packages
--------

Package build results are in the pkg-bin/ directory.  All packages in this
directory are put into the ttylinux file system and bootable image.

Images
------

The build results are in the img directory; there are a file system image and
a boot CD-ROM ISO image.

sysroot
-------

There is a sysroot directory containing the entire incremental build; the
ttylinux packages are constructed by taking some of the files from the sysroot.
Usually most files are used, but in the case of GLIBC there are many files not
used in the ttylinux package: the internationalization, i18n, and localization,
l10n, files.

The build can be interactively evaluated by executing the following command if
the ttylinux build is of the same architecture as the build host e.g., you are 
building ttylinux on a typical 32-bit or multilib x86 Linux system and build
the i486 ttylinux:

     $ . ttylinux-chroot.sh

The above command sets your top-level root directory to be the ttylinunx
sysroot, so you are still running your build system's kernel but using the
ttylinux build as the root directory.

The sysroot directory can be used as an NFS root.  If you NFS export the
sysroot directory, you can start ttylinux with a boot line something like:

     ttylinux nofsck nofirewall \
              root=nfs \
              nfsroot=X.Y.Z.P1:/<path> \
              ip=X.Y.Z.P2

Bootable CD-ROM
----------------

You can burn the boot CD-ROM ISO image to a CD-ROM and boot it; try this
command:

     $ make media

Bootable USB Drive
------------------

The build/cdrom directory contains the CD-ROM mastering image source files,
include Linux kernel and file system image.  There is a shell script that can
be used to make USB disk bootable with ttylinux.  The shell script is in the
sysroot/sbin/ directory; it is "ttylinux-flash".  This shell script is in the
ttylinux file system, so ttylinux itself is capable of making a USB disk
bootable with ttylinux.  Either lilo or syslinux can be used as the boot loader
on the USB disk; the script options used to indicate lilo and syslinux are
"-l", "--lilo", "-s" and "--syslinux".

Example:

     On your host system, if you have a USB disk mounted at /mnt/flash on device
     /dev/sda1, then try one of the following command.

     $ sysroot/sbin/ttylinux-flash --lilo build/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sda
     $ sysroot/sbin/ttylinux-flash -s build/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sda

Example:

     From a CD-ROM-booted ttylinux system, if you have a USB disk mounted at
     /mnt/flash on device /dev/sda1 and the CD-ROM mounted on /mnt/cdrom, then
     try one of the following command.

     $ ttylinux-flash -l /mnt/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sda
     $ ttylinux-flash --syslinux /mnt/cdrom /mnt/flash /dev/sda


==================
7. Common Problems
==================

-------------------------------------
7.1. ttylinux Build-time AWK Problems
-------------------------------------

Only GNU awk will work.  If you have mawk, replace it with GNU awk.
Get gawk-4.0.0.tar.bz2 at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/gawk-4.0.0.tar.bz2

-----------------------
7.2. lilo Build Problem
-----------------------

You need the dev86 package to build lilo.
Get Dev86src-0.16.18.tar.gz at http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/
http://www.debath.co.uk/dev86/Dev86src-0.16.18.tar.gz

--------------------------
7.3. bash Run-time Problem
--------------------------

You built ttylinux and find the $(...) construct does not work; you have this
weird bash behavior:

     $ echo $(ls)
     bash: command substitution: line 78: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
     bash: command substitution: line 78: `ls)'

You need to build bash with a better bison (yacc) on your host. bash uses yacc
grammar rules and your yacc does not generate the correct parsing code for the
bash build.

Get bison-2.5.tar.bz2 at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-2.5.tar.bz2

=======================
8. Bug Reports and Help
=======================

It is a goal to support building ttylinux on any normal Linux x86 distribution.
Reporting bugs in xbuildtool, ttylinux and their documents is appreciated.

There is a web-based forum that is active from time to time; it is active on
date this was written, 2010-03-11, and is intended to be active as long as
minimalinux is supporting ttylinux, barring spammer abuse.

     http://www.minimalinux.org/forum/

Help may be available on irc, which is very low bandwith and seemingly more
appropriate for inane banter that sometimes is fun.
